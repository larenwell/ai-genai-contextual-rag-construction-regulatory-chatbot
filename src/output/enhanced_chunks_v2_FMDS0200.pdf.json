It is part of the broader guidelines for ensuring the proper installation and operation of automatic sprinkler systems to mitigate fire risks.\n\nThe fragment presents three key strategies for handling airflow in relation to ceiling sprinkler systems:\n1. **Automatic Shutdown**: The airflow source should be designed to shut down automatically upon activation of the ceiling sprinkler waterflow alarm. This ensures that airflow does not interfere with the sprinkler system's operation during a fire event.\n2. **Design Adjustments for Wet and Dry Systems**: If the ceiling sprinkler system is wet or a similar type, the system should be designed as if it were a dry sprinkler system. If a dry system design is not provided, the indicated wet sprinkler system design area should be increased by 30%.

These components are integral to the proper functioning of dry-pipe sprinkler systems, which are one of the several types of sprinkler systems covered in the document.\n\nThe **dry-pipe valve** is an automatic water control valve typically installed on the riser of a sprinkler system. It uses a pressurized gaseous medium (such as air or nitrogen) to hold back water on the upstream side. The valve remains closed until the gas pressure on the downstream side drops, which occurs when a sprinkler activates. This drop in pressure allows the valve to open, permitting water to flow into the system. Like an **alarm check valve**, the dry-pipe valve is equipped with an alarm notification system to alert in the event of water flow. Additionally, it includes a means of measuring gas pressure within the system and provides an alarm if a low-pressure condition is detected.\n\nThe **dry-sidewall automatic sprinkler** is a type of dry sprinkler where the sprinkler attached to the extension nipple is oriented sideways. This design is particularly useful in areas where upright or pendent sprinklers may not be practical.\n\n#### **Relation to the Document**\nThis fragment aligns with **Section 2.0** of the document, specifically under the subsections on **types of sprinkler systems** and **components**. It provides detailed technical information on specific elements of dry-pipe systems, which are critical for ensuring proper installation and operation. The fragment also relates to the **operation and maintenance** guidelines, as understanding these components is essential for effective system upkeep.\n\n#### **Visual Elements**\nThe fragment contains **text only**, without any diagrams or figures. However, the full document likely includes visual aids such as diagrams of dry-pipe valve arrangements and sprinkler placements, which would help illustrate the concepts discussed.\n\n#### **Key Terminology**\n- **Dry-pipe valve**\n- **Alarm check valve**\n- **Dry-sidewall automatic sprinkler**\n- **Gas pressure**\n- **Sprinkler system**\n\nThis summary provides a concise yet informative overview of the fragment, preserving technical accuracy and contextual relevance within the broader document.",
