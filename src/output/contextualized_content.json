It is part of the broader section on loss prevention recommendations, specifically addressing the operational and maintenance aspects of corrosion control in sprinkler systems.\n\nThe fragment emphasizes the importance of replacing any section of pipe where the remaining wall thickness falls below the thresholds outlined in Table 1. This table provides a guideline for determining whether piping should be retained or replaced, based on the percentage of wall remaining in any single pit for different pipe schedules. For instance, Schedule 40 pipes should be replaced if less than 25% of the wall thickness remains, while Schedule 10 and Schedule 5 pipes require replacement if less than 50% and 75% of the wall thickness remains, respectively. Hybrid schedules also follow the 75% threshold.\n\nThe note accompanying the table clarifies that the guidelines are based on engineering judgment and several cases of corrosion examined by FM.

The recommendations aim to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of fire protection systems by addressing specific operational and maintenance practices.\n\nThe fragment provides detailed guidelines for managing air and pressure within wet-pipe sprinkler systems. It emphasizes the importance of removing trapped air to prevent corrosion and other issues. Specifically, it recommends installing automatic or manual air-release valves at system high points, with a minimum size of 1/2 inch (13 mm), and ensuring that air is removed after each system drain and refill. This practice helps maintain the system's integrity and functionality.\n\nAdditionally, the fragment advises installing a pressure-relief valve, preferably at the riser or inspector's test connection, to manage pressure increases due to thermal expansion. The valve should be at least 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) in size and set to operate at pressures exceeding the system's maximum rated working pressure, typically 175 psi (12 bar). This measure is crucial for preventing damage to the system components caused by excessive pressure.\n\nThe visual element referenced in the fragment is Figure 1, which illustrates a wet sprinkler piping system equipped with an automatic air-release valve.

This process is crucial for maintaining the reliability and effectiveness of fire protection systems by mitigating corrosion risks, particularly in wet-pipe systems where water is constantly present.\n\nThe nitrogen inerting process involves filling and purging the system with nitrogen to create an inert environment that prevents corrosion. The document outlines two methods for this procedure: manual and automatic. The manual method requires draining the system completely, injecting compressed nitrogen to reach a pressure of approximately 30 psi (2 bar), and then purging the system to 0 psi (0 bar). The nitrogen concentration is determined by taking a reading at a vent located at the remote end of the system. The automatic method, on the other hand, can be completed with the system in service if an auto-purge device has already been installed. For engineered nitrogen systems, it is essential to follow the manufacturer's recommendations and fill/purge procedures.\n\nThe visual elements in the fragment include lists that clearly outline the steps for the manual method, providing a structured and easy-to-follow guide for professionals involved in the maintenance and inspection of sprinkler systems.\n\nThis fragment is part of the broader content structure of the document, which includes sections on corrosion chemistry, supervisory nitrogen gas, and various types of corrosion such as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) and galvanized steel pipe issues.
