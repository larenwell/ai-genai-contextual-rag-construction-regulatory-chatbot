        "### Contextualized Summary of Fragment\n\nThis fragment describes the setup and conditions for the FM Duct Test, a fire test detailed in the document \"FIRE TESTS.\" The test evaluates the fire performance of duct materials used in ventilation systems. The exhaust end of the duct is connected to a blower through a steel transition piece, which pulls air through the duct at specified velocities. The fire exposure is created using a 4-inch (102 mm) depth of heptane in a 12-inch (305 mm) square pan, producing a heat output of approximately 10,000 Btu/min (176 kW).\n\nThe test specifies different air velocities for different types of ducts: 600 linear ft/min (3.05 m/s) for ducts handling environmental air and chemical or corrosive fume exhaust ducts, with some cases requiring 2000 ft/min (10.2 m/s). This information is crucial for understanding the fire resistance and spread potential of duct materials under various conditions.\n\nThe fragment includes formulas related to air velocities and heat output, which are essential for replicating the test conditions and interpreting the results. These technical details are part of the broader discussion on fire tests in the document, which aims to provide guidelines for fire safety and loss prevention in construction materials.\n\nThis summary contextualizes the fragment within the document's overall structure, preserving key technical information and maintaining specific terminology for accurate search and reference. | ### Contextualized Summary of Fragment\n\nThis fragment discusses the performance criteria and results of the FM Duct Test, a fire test mentioned in the document \"FIRE TESTS\" (FMDS0104.pdf, Page 5). The FM Duct Test evaluates the fire spread and temperature resistance of duct materials, which is crucial for assessing the fire hazard of construction materials.\n\nThe fragment specifies that the performance of a duct is considered satisfactory if, during the 15-minute test, flaming does not spread beyond the 24 ft (7.32 m) point, and the interior duct temperatures at the far end do not exceed 1000°F (538°C). This criterion ensures that the duct material can withstand fire conditions without contributing to fire spread or excessive heat buildup.\n\nThe fragment also notes that many plastic ducts have failed this test, despite having low flame spread ratings (ASTM E-84 ratings of 25 or less). This highlights the discrepancy between small-scale tests (like ASTM E-84) and large-scale tests, which is a key theme in the document. The ASTM E-84 test may not fully predict the performance of materials in real-world fire conditions, as illustrated by the failure of plastic ducts with low flame spread ratings.\n\nThe visual element mentioned, Figure 2, shows a test of a plastic duct that failed the FM Duct Test, despite having a flame spread rating of 25 according to the ASTM E-84 test. This visual reinforces the point that small-scale test results may not always correlate with large-scale test outcomes.\n\nIn summary, this fragment emphasizes the importance of large-scale fire tests in evaluating the fire performance of duct materials and the limitations of small-scale tests in predicting real-world fire behavior. The technical information, including specific performance criteria and test results, is preserved to maintain the document's accuracy and relevance for fire safety professionals. | ### Contextualized Summary of Fragment\n\nThe fragment contains two figures related to the FM Duct Test, which is one of the fire tests detailed in the document \"FIRE TESTS\" (FMDS0104.pdf, Page 6). The FM Duct Test is designed to evaluate the fire performance of air handling duct work, specifically focusing on the flame spread characteristics of materials used in such applications.\n\n**Figure 1** illustrates the FM apparatus used for evaluating air handling duct work.

          "text": "### Contextualized Summary of Fragment\n\nThis fragment describes the setup and conditions for the FM Duct Test, a fire test detailed in the document \"FIRE TESTS.\" The test evaluates the fire performance of duct materials used in ventilation systems. The exhaust end of the duct is connected to a blower through a steel transition piece, which pulls air through the duct at specified velocities. The fire exposure is created using a 4-inch (102 mm) depth of heptane in a 12-inch (305 mm) square pan, producing a heat output of approximately 10,000 Btu/min (176 kW).\n\nThe test specifies different air velocities for different types of ducts: 600 linear ft/min (3.05 m/s) for ducts handling environmental air and chemical or corrosive fume exhaust ducts, with some cases requiring 2000 ft/min (10.2 m/s). This information is crucial for understanding the fire resistance and spread potential of duct materials under various conditions.\n\nThe fragment includes formulas related to air velocities and heat output, which are essential for replicating the test conditions and interpreting the results. These technical details are part of the broader discussion on fire tests in the document, which aims to provide guidelines for fire safety and loss prevention in construction materials.\n\nThis summary contextualizes the fragment within the document's overall structure, preserving key technical information and maintaining specific terminology for accurate search and reference.",

The FM Duct Test evaluates the fire spread and temperature resistance of duct materials, which is crucial for assessing the fire hazard of construction materials.\n\nThe fragment specifies that the performance of a duct is considered satisfactory if, during the 15-minute test, flaming does not spread beyond the 24 ft (7.32 m) point, and the interior duct temperatures at the far end do not exceed 1000°F (538°C). This criterion ensures that the duct material can withstand fire conditions without contributing to fire spread or excessive heat buildup.\n\nThe fragment also notes that many plastic ducts have failed this test, despite having low flame spread ratings (ASTM E-84 ratings of 25 or less). This highlights the discrepancy between small-scale tests (like ASTM E-84) and large-scale tests, which is a key theme in the document. The ASTM E-84 test may not fully predict the performance of materials in real-world fire conditions, as illustrated by the failure of plastic ducts with low flame spread ratings.\n\nThe visual element mentioned, Figure 2, shows a test of a plastic duct that failed the FM Duct Test, despite having a flame spread rating of 25 according to the ASTM E-84 test. This visual reinforces the point that small-scale test results may not always correlate with large-scale test outcomes.\n\nIn summary, this fragment emphasizes the importance of large-scale fire tests in evaluating the fire performance of duct materials and the limitations of small-scale tests in predicting real-world fire behavior. The technical information, including specific performance criteria and test results, is preserved to maintain the document's accuracy and relevance for fire safety professionals.",
