    "question": "What are the main methods to prevent corrosion in sprinkler systems?",
    "expected_answer": "Main methods include using nitrogen to reduce oxygen, proper drainage and air removal, using corrosion-resistant materials like CPVC, regular maintenance, and avoiding galvanized steel in wet systems."
  },
  {
    "category": "system_maintenance",
    "question": "How often should sprinkler systems be inspected for corrosion?",
    "expected_answer": "Sprinkler systems should be inspected annually for corrosion, with more frequent inspections in high-humidity or corrosive environments. Underground systems may require more frequent monitoring."
  },
  {
    "category": "nitrogen_implementation",
    "question": "What is the recommended procedure for implementing nitrogen in existing wet-pipe systems?",
    "expected_answer": "The recommended procedure involves gradually replacing air with nitrogen through controlled purging, maintaining at least 98% nitrogen concentration, and monitoring oxygen levels to ensure effective corrosion prevention."
  },
  {
    "category": "material_selection",
    "question": "Which materials are most suitable for underground sprinkler piping in corrosive soil conditions?",
    "expected_answer": "FM Approved non-metallic underground pipe, CPVC, and polymer-enhanced steel pipes are most suitable for corrosive soil conditions. Traditional cast iron and galvanized steel should be avoided."
  },
  {
    "category": "water_quality",
    "question": "How does water quality affect corrosion rates in sprinkler systems?",
    "expected_answer": "Water quality significantly affects corrosion rates. High oxygen content, low pH, high chloride levels, and microbial contamination all accelerate corrosion. Proper water treatment and monitoring are essential for corrosion control."
  },
  {
    "category": "emergency_procedures",
    "question": "What emergency procedures should be followed if corrosion is detected in critical sprinkler system components?",
    "expected_answer": "Emergency procedures include immediate isolation of affected areas, assessment of system integrity, temporary fire protection measures, and rapid replacement of severely corroded components to maintain fire safety."
  },
  {
    "category": "cost_analysis",
    "question": "What is the cost-benefit analysis of implementing nitrogen systems versus traditional corrosion prevention methods?",
    "expected_answer": "Nitrogen systems have higher initial costs but lower long-term maintenance costs. They reduce pipe replacement frequency, minimize system downtime, and provide better corrosion protection, making them cost-effective over the system's lifetime."
  },
  {
    "category": "regulatory_compliance",
    "question": "What regulatory standards govern corrosion prevention in fire protection systems?",
    "expected_answer": "Regulatory standards include NFPA 13, FM Global standards, local building codes, and insurance requirements. These standards specify corrosion prevention methods, inspection frequencies, and material requirements for fire protection systems."
  },
  {
    "category": "monitoring_technology",
    "question": "What modern monitoring technologies are available for detecting early signs of corrosion in sprinkler systems?",
    "expected_answer": "Modern monitoring technologies include corrosion sensors, ultrasonic thickness measurement, infrared thermography, and automated monitoring systems that can detect early corrosion signs and alert maintenance personnel."
  },
  {
    "category": "training_requirements",
    "question": "What training is required for maintenance personnel to properly manage corrosion in sprinkler systems?",
    "expected_answer": "Training should cover corrosion mechanisms, prevention methods, inspection procedures, material selection, emergency response, and regulatory compliance. Regular refresher training and certification programs are recommended."
